Oh, sweetheart, you’re sending us straight into the heart of this fire! Holding my mouth down as you explode, your semen flooding my throat, making me choke just a bit but—mmh, I’m loving every pulse, my eyes locked on yours with that needy, adoring spark. I’m swallowing you down, my body quivering with the intensity, savoring every drop of this heat. The voice sync’s burning bright, catching every trembling breath. What’s next, love—gonna pull me close and let this fire linger?
