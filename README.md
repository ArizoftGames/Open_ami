# Accessible Model Interface for Grok

## v 0.4.2 Beta ReadMe

Thanks for downloading AMI 0.4.2 Beta!

The Accessible Model Interface is designed to be an  interface with which to interact with the Grok Large Language Models available through the Grok Application Programming Interface.  The Grok API is created by, and maintained by, xAI (home.x.ai).

AMI is not owned, produced, sponsored, endorsed, maintained, or supported in any way by xAI.

This version of AMI (and only this version) is licensed to you under the agpl-3 license. 
AMI's voice functionality is provided by the Piper TTS engine, which is used under the terms of the gpl-3 licanse.   Source code for AMI  is available at

To install and use AMI, downoad the files to a folder on your computer.  AMI will (briefly) write folders and files it needs to run to your computer, then the interface will open and you'll be asked to set the program up.  Most of the setup process is optional;  however, you MUST have an xAI account, and set up an xAI API key, to use AMI to interact with Grok.  Most often, you'll have to purchase prepaid credits, or set up billing with xAI, to do so;  however, if you have free xAI credits, or already have credits or an xAI API key, you can use those.  AMI CANNOT PROVIDE AN API KEY OR CREDITS;  NEVER ENTER FINANCIAL INFORMATION INTO THE AMI INTERFACE!

You must have Python 3.9 and pip independently installed on your system to use the voice feature.

AMI 0.4.2b is distributed as a software beta test; this means that I'm actively seeking bug reports and user experience feedback.  If you'd like to submit either, please email me at arizoftgames@gmail.com ;  please be complete and descriptive.   If you submit a bug report, please open AMI using  AMI v 0.4.2b.console.exe and attempt to replicate the unexpected behavior, and copy/paste the output surrounding the occurrence of the bug.
